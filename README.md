# JarvisChatBot

This is a chatbot that is themed around the comic book character ironman. The GUI was created in Python, and utilizes tagging along with keras and tensorflow for Deep learning text capabilities. This chatbot also features built in features like background music, animations, and text to speech functions. I plan to add a few more features to it including speech recognition and multiprocessing/threading so that the animations and text output do not slow during text to speech process.
